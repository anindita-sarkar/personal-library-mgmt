You&apos;ll learn how to bypass the tedious configuration steps so that you can concentrate on your application&apos;s behavior.  Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.  About the Technology  The Spring Framework simplifies enterprise Java development, but it does require lots of tedious configuration work. Spring Boot radically streamlines spinning up a Spring application. You get automatic configuration and a model with established conventions for build-time and runtime dependencies. You also get a handy command-line interface you can use to write scripts in Groovy. Developers who use Spring Boot often say that they can&apos;t imagine going back to hand configuring their applications. About the Book  Spring Boot in Action is a developer-focused guide to writing applications using Spring Boot. In it, you&apos;ll learn how to bypass configuration steps so you can focus on your application&apos;s behavior. Spring expert Craig Walls uses interesting and practical examples to teach you both how to use the default settings effectively and how to override and customize Spring Boot for your unique environment. Along the way, you&apos;ll pick up insights from Craig&apos;s years of Spring development experience.  What&apos;s Inside  Develop Spring apps more efficiently Minimal to no configuration Runtime metrics with the Actuator Covers Spring Boot 1.3 About the Reader  Written for readers familiar with the Spring Framework.  About the Author  Craig Walls is a software developer, author of the popular book Spring in Action, Fourth Edition, and a frequent speaker at conferences. Table of Contents  Bootstarting Spring Developing your first Spring Boot application Customizing configuration Testing with Spring Boot Getting Groovy with the Spring Boot CLI Applying Grails in Spring Boot Taking a peek inside with the Actuator Deploying Spring Boot applications APPENDIXES Spring Boot developer tools Spring Boot starters Configuration properties Spring Boot dependencies"/>

This practical guide shows how Apache ZooKeeper helps you manage distributed systems, so you can focus mainly on application logic. Even with ZooKeeper, implementing coordination tasks is not trivial, but this book provides good practices to give you a head start, and points out caveats that developers and administrators alike need to watch for along the way.  In three separate sections, ZooKeeper contributors Flavio Junqueira and Benjamin Reed introduce the principles of distributed systems, provide ZooKeeper programming techniques, and include the information you need to administer this service.  Learn how ZooKeeper solves common coordination tasks Explore the ZooKeeper API&#x2019;s Java and C implementations and how they differ Use methods to track and react to ZooKeeper state changes Handle failures of the network, application processes, and ZooKeeper itself Learn about ZooKeeper&#x2019;s trickier aspects dealing with concurrency, ordering, and configuration Use the Curator high-level interface for connection management Become familiar with ZooKeeper internals and administration tools"/>
